# Creating Interactive React Components

Interactive components are at the heart of modern web applications. They create engaging experiences that keep users coming back.

## The Basics of Interactivity

React makes it easy to create interactive components with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## Animation and Transitions

Smooth animations enhance the user experience. With Tailwind CSS, you can easily add transitions:

```css
transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple**: Don't over-complicate interactions
2. **Performance Matters**: Optimize animations for smooth 60fps
3. **Accessibility First**: Ensure interactive elements work with keyboard and screen readers
